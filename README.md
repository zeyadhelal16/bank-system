This Bank System is a full-stack web application designed to simulate real-world banking operations in a simple and practical way. The system allows users to create accounts, securely log in, check their balance, deposit money, withdraw funds, and transfer money to other users.

The front-end of the application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a clean and user-friendly interface. The back-end is developed with Node.js and Express, handling all server-side logic, account validation, and transaction processing. User data, including account details and transaction history, is stored using JSON to keep the system lightweight and easy to manage.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how a banking system works behind the scenes, including authentication, balance management, and secure transaction handling. It reflects real-world concepts such as account verification, data persistence, and structured transaction records.

This project showcases full-stack development skills and highlights the integration between front-end design and back-end functionality to build a complete, working web application.
